# avaChat_Holo
In avaChat, you could achieve a wholly new experience of chatting. Users can define their avatars in profile settings in 3D. When talking with others, they can see their own and their friend's avatars on the screen, and these avatars will help to express the chatters' mood with body language and facial expression.

What's more, avaChat can save user's chatting history in a particular way, which helps them keep precious memories. Besides, avaChat can also be built as a cross-platform plugin so as to be used on every popular chat app. AR chatting mode is also provided to see the avatar standing in the real scenes.

avaChat_Holo is the extension of the avaChat on Microsoft HoloLens. It allows you to communicate with others in your real world! Powered by holographic UI, users may feel immersed in the chat and interact with the talker actively.
